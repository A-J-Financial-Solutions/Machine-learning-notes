# Machine Learning Notes Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Notes Repository! This repository is a curated collection of my personal notes, focusing on various machine learning concepts and techniques, including CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Elliott Wave Theory. The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured and accessible platform for anyone interested in learning about these topics, whether for academic purposes, professional development, or personal interest.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several main directories, each dedicated to a specific topic or concept within machine learning:

- [**Notes**](Notes/): This directory contains the Markdown files for each topic. Each topic is further divided into subtopics, providing a detailed exploration of the subject matter.
  - [**CNN**](Notes/CNN/): Notes on Convolutional Neural Networks, covering basics, architectures, and applications.
  - [**CNN-LSTM**](Notes/CNN-LSTM/): Insights into the combined CNN-LSTM architecture, including its overview, detailed architectures, and applications.
- [**Images**](Images/): This directory stores images and diagrams referenced in the notes. Images are organized by topic for easy access and reference.
- [**Resources**](Resources/): Contains additional resources, datasets, or scripts that complement the notes or provide practical examples.
- [**References.md**](References.md): A compiled list of references and external resources that have been cited or used throughout the notes.

## Navigating the Repository

To navigate this repository, you can start by exploring the `Notes` directory, where each subdirectory represents a specific topic within machine learning. Inside each subdirectory, you will find Markdown files dedicated to different aspects or subtopics of the main subject. Images and diagrams referenced in the notes can be found in the `Images` directory, organized by topic.

If you're looking for additional resources or examples, the `Resources` directory may contain relevant files. For a comprehensive list of all references and external sources, check the [References](References.md) file.

## How to Use These Notes

These notes are designed to be a self-contained learning resource. You can start with the basics and progress through more advanced topics at your own pace. The notes are interlinked, allowing you to navigate between related topics easily. Diagrams, code snippets, and examples are provided to enhance understanding and offer practical insights into the concepts discussed.

Feel free to clone this repository, explore the notes, and use them as a reference or a guide in your machine learning journey.

## Contributing
